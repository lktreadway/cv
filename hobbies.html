    <h3>Art</h3>
    <p class="description">
      I have dabbled in oils, charcoals, pastels, alcohol inks, etc. My favorite mediums are watercolor, inks, and mixed media.
      As you can see in the banner above, my current passion is creating Neurographic Art using watercolor and ink. Click <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=neurographic+art+definition&oq=neurographic+art&aqs=chrome.2.69i57j0i512l9.10528j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">here</a>,
      if you want to learn more about Neurographic Art. I love all types of art. However, my favorites include abstract, waterscapes, and landscapes.
      Not necessarily in that order or combination. Check out <a href="#">my art website</a> to see what I am currently
      working on and my portfolio of artwork for sale. A friend recently suggested composing an adult coloring book using my artwork. Let me know your thoughts. I'd love to hear them.

    <h3>Music</h3>
    <p class="description">
      I love most types of music, but my favorites include Jazz, Classic Rock, and R&B.
      I have sung for most of my life in one choir or another. I was even given credit for participating
      on an album my church produced. I did harmony backup vocals. It is an awsome worship CD called <em>Season of Praise</em>.
      Check it out <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001BQOHRY/ref=ntt_mus_dp_dpt_1" target="_blank">here</a> to listen to some sound clips.
      Music has always been part of my life.
      I love rhythm's paradoxical qualities of complexity and simplicity. Rhythm is foundational, strong, and supportive.
      Without rhythm, there is no music, no life. As with any foundation, if it crumbles, so does everything else.
      I've tried out other instruments over the years, but none appeal to me as much as percussion. It is my soul instrument.

    <!--<h3>Sports</h3>
    <p class="description">
      I played tennis, volleyball, and golf in high school. These days I play <a href="http://www.usapa.org" target="_blank">Pickleball</a>.
      Other activities I enjoy are walking and cycling in the great outdoors.
    </p>-->
    <h3>Other</h3>
    <p class="description">
      Other pastimes I enjoy include: reading and writing, both fiction and non-fiction;
      researching health topics; and analyzing statistical data, namely lottery numbers.
      I love any type of puzzle and problem-solving or pattern recognition activities (i.e. sudoku, word games, programming)
