                <p> Current class. This class covers the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, as well as other aspects of Fullstack development.<br />
                  Class length: 60 hours.<br />

                  My motto: Chaos does not exist. There is only a level of complexity yet to be discovered and understood.<br />
                  <br />I love numbers. I love puzzles. I find lottery numbers, or any set of data, fascinating to study. <br />
                  Statistical biases and pattern recognition is a favorite hobby of mine.<br />
                  <br />Eventually, I plan to have a membership website that will provide a host of staticial reports for just about any lottery game in the U.S.<br />
                  <br />This site build is currently in process. Client-side: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML. Server-side: Node.js and MongoDB.
